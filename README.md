# Spotly

Spotly app is designed for saving and exploring locations using Google Maps, allowing users to add their favorite spots effortlessly. With this app, you can capture an image of your location, edit it, and save it. Spotly enables you to store, annotate, organize, and share your favorite places in a user-friendly manner.

Discover an interesting location? Give it a title, add text notes, specify the date, and upload images from your camera roll or take new ones directly with your device's camera. You can also edit or delete any location.                     
Keep your places organized by grouping them into Collections. For instance, if you're on holiday in London and want to remember the beautiful spots you visited, simply create a collection named "Holiday in London" and add your visited locations, possibly including some lovely pictures and their coordinates.

Use the search feature to find distant places by name, and customize app settings to your liking (such as enabling notifications or switching to light mode). Share your favorite locations with friends!

The Spotly app was developed by students at Gothenburg University as part of the TIG333 course in October 2024.
